# #855: reclaim disk space left behind when a vm_bundles bundle
# migrated from the pre-3.0 win32-manifest-repurposed rootfs.vhdx
# format to the official unix-native rootfs.img format.
#
# Before the v3.0.0 official-deb rebase, Linux Cowork worked by
# repurposing the win32 manifest's VHDX entries (no native "unix"
# manifest existed yet) and converting them to qcow2 on first use.
# Anthropic's manifest has since grown a real "unix" platform entry
# serving rootfs.img directly, and the official coworkd uses that
# format without ever touching the old VHDX pair again once it
# exists. Nothing deletes the superseded files, so a bundle that
# predates the switch keeps ~11 GB of dead rootfs.vhdx /
# rootfs.vhdx.zst forever.
#
# rootfs.img present is treated as proof the migration completed; a
# bundle still on the old format alone (no rootfs.img yet) is left
# untouched so an in-progress or vhdx-only install isn't disturbed.
# The only code that ever read rootfs.vhdx on Linux is the 2.x KVM
# backend in scripts/cowork-fallback/cowork-vm-service.js (vhdx ->
# qcow2 on first use). It still exists but is unreachable in 3.x:
# the daemon only spawns behind the asar gate
# COWORK_VM_BACKEND=bwrap, and that value selects the bwrap backend
# inside it. So no reachable path needs the vhdx once img exists.

# P1 (#768): rotate out-of-band backups of the user config and the
# per-account Cowork store index files before launch, so the
# poisoned-cache / corrupt-load wipe class is recoverable. Upstream's
# config loader silently falls back to {} on a failed cold-start read
# and then serializes the whole cached object over the file on the next
# settings write; the Cowork stores (spaces / remote-session-spaces /
# scheduled-tasks) share the same rewrite-from-memory shape. See
# anthropics/claude-code #32345 / #59640 / #63651 and
# docs/learnings/config-wipe-guard.md.
#
# We cannot fix upstream's write path from the launcher, but this keeps
# the last few good copies out of band. It runs BEFORE Electron starts,
# so it captures the previous session's (good) state; after an
# in-session wipe the good copy is still down the rotation. This is the
# patch-zero-clean primary fix — it covers every wipe mode (corrupt
# JSON, ENOENT, single-bad-entry Zod) that an in-band asar guard would
# miss. Rotation keeps $keep copies per file and only rotates on a
# real change, so it neither churns nor evicts the pre-wipe copy on
# every launch. Fail-safe: never blocks launch.

# run_doctor and its helpers live in doctor.sh alongside this file. Sourced
# here so any consumer of launcher-common.sh gets the full run_doctor entry
# point without needing to know about the split. Each packaging target
# (deb/rpm/AppImage/Nix) installs doctor.sh next to launcher-common.sh.
