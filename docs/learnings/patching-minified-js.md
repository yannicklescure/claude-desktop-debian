# Patching minified JavaScript

Hard-won lessons from maintaining a long-lived patch suite against an
actively re-minified upstream. Each section names a failure mode and
the fix.

The verification recipes below use claude-desktop-debian-specific
incantations (the pinned official `.deb`, `ar` + `tar` extraction,
`build.sh --build appimage`); substitute your own project's
fetch/extract/build commands as needed. Worked examples drawn from
`tray.sh` and `cowork.sh` refer to patches deleted in the v3.0.0 rebase
onto Anthropic's official Linux `.deb` (`cowork.sh` is preserved
unwired under `scripts/cowork-fallback/`); the lessons stand and each
such example is marked where it appears.

## Capturing identifiers: `\w` doesn't match `$`

JS identifiers allow `$` and `_`; minifiers freely emit names like
`$e`, `C$i`, `g$x`. The character class `\w` is `[A-Za-z0-9_]` — it
does not match `$`. A `(\w+)` against `$e` captures the suffix `e`
and returns a name that doesn't exist in the file. The failure is
silent: regex matches, downstream sed runs against a truncated name,
asar ships broken JS. Three recurrences (PRs #253, #421, #555) before
the convention stuck.

Use `[$\w]+` (repo convention; `[\w$]+` is equivalent). Strict
superset of `\w+`, so pre-`$` versions still match. From
`cowork.sh:484-502` (historical example — patch deleted in v3.0.0,
lesson stands):

```bash
const fsMatch = region.match(/([$\w]+)\.existsSync\(/);
```

### A capture narrower than the shape splices mid-identifier

`[$\w]+` fixes the character class. The same failure recurs one
widening later at the level of the *shape*: a capture that cannot
express the whole construct still matches its tail, and regex
engines match leftmost-**possible**, not leftmost-intended.

`tray-icon-selection.sh` captured the DE-detector callee as
"bare identifier, or the `(0,x.y)` indirect form" while the electron
handle one line down already allowed `[\w$]+(?:\.[\w$]+)*`. Against
1.26832.0's pristine ternary the asymmetry bit:

```js
t=p.lt()===`gnome`||R.nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors?`TrayIconLinux-Dark.png`:…
```

The match started at `lt`, the `p.` stayed in the retained prefix, and
the splice glued the injected expression onto it:

```js
t=p.process.env.CLAUDE_TRAY_USE_DARK_ICON==="1"||…
```

`p` carries no `process` property in that scope, so the tray builder
threw on its first read, the tray never registered, and the global
Sentry handler swallowed it. Two releases shipped that way (1.26832.0,
1.28929.0); 1.30096.x and 1.32885.1 happened to emit a bare callee and
were clean. Whether a release breaks is luck of the minifier.

Four things generalize:

- **Keep captures for the same construct symmetric.** Two adjacent
  captures of "a callee" that admit different shapes is a bug waiting
  for the minifier to find it.
- **A match-count assertion is not a splice assertion.** The
  exactly-1 check passed throughout — there *was* exactly one ternary.
  Count says the shape is present; it says nothing about where the
  match begins. Assert the splice point separately, so a shape the
  capture cannot express hard-fails instead of corrupting the bundle.
- **Assert the splice point with an allowlist, not a denylist.** The
  first cut of that guard rejected a preceding `[\w$.]`, which reads as
  equivalent and isn't: `await lt()` walks through it (the preceding
  char is a space) and moves the `await` onto the injected expression,
  and `this.#lt()` walks through it to emit `this.#process.env.…`, an
  undeclared private name — a SyntaxError that takes out the whole main
  chunk rather than just the tray. Enumerating bad prefixes only moves
  the goalposts to the next shape nobody pictured, which is the same
  mistake one level up. State the requirement positively instead: the
  retained prefix must *end an expression*, so its last non-whitespace
  token has to be a punctuator that can be followed by a fresh one
  (`[=(,;:?|{[]`, `=>`) or `return`. Choose that set against the real
  bundles rather than from the grammar, and pin it from *both* sides: a
  fixture per way a prefix can survive the match, and a fixture per
  prefix that must keep passing, because an allowlist tightened one
  character too far is a spurious build failure on a release nobody is
  watching. `&` stays out because an `a&&` prefix would be absorbed by
  the injected `||`-chain and the guard it expresses silently lost.
  `|` is in — but as the status quo, not as a clean composition: with
  `e||` retained in front, the `=0` state reduces to `e||!1||!1` → `e`.
  Read what the surviving operand *is* before sizing the consequence:
  `e` turned out to be upstream's tray rebuild flag, `!1` on a normal
  build and `!0` only on the retry after a caught tray-creation
  exception, so the override is lost on that retry alone rather than
  generally (#876). A prefix the anchor cannot see is a limit on the
  patch's *reach*, which the splice guard neither creates nor fixes;
  note it rather than letting a passing test imply the semantics were
  checked.
- **An idempotency guard keyed to a substring can be satisfied by the
  corruption.** `code.includes(applied)` matched the mispatched text,
  because `p.` + `applied` contains `applied`. The second pass logged
  "already applied" and shipped the damage. Run every occurrence
  through the same splice-point predicate: one that doesn't start an
  expression means a prior build spliced mid-expression, so the bundle
  is corrupt rather than patched and deserves its own named failure.

The test that would have caught it is a fixture in the shape the
capture cannot express. `tray-icon-selection.bats` covered the
`(0,Ei.oPe)()` indirect form and a bare callee, never a plain `p.lt()`
chain, which is why the suite stayed green through both broken
releases. The near-miss fixtures that pin the splice guard are chosen
the same way — `p?.lt()`, `await lt()`, `this.#lt()` — one shape per
way a prefix can survive the match, plus an `e||AL()` fixture that
must keep *passing* so the allowlist can't be tightened into a
false hard-fail.

## The beautified false-negative trap

Testing a regex against `build-reference/` is not verification. The
beautified copy has whitespace the regex doesn't account for.

During PR #555, both `\w+` and `[\w$]+` tested false against the
beautified file. Shipped minified bytes:

```js
await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,g$x))
```

Beautified copy:

```js
await new Promise((n) => setTimeout(n, g$x))
```

`await new Promise\(([\w$]+)=>\s*setTimeout\(\1,\s*([\w$]+)\)\)` fails
the beautified version on the parens and spaces around `=>`. Always
close the loop against shipped bytes.

## Whitespace tolerance: `\s*` vs `[ \t]*`

`\s` matches newlines. A `\s*`-padded pattern is a license to span
across structural boundaries the original line layout meant to
keep apart — usually fine on minified bytes (no newlines to span),
much looser on beautified.

Use `[ \t]*` when the intent is "spaces but stay on this line."
Reserve `\s*` for crossing structural boundaries on purpose. The
`cowork.sh` patches (historical example — patch deleted in v3.0.0,
lesson stands) mixed both — `\s*` where the surrounding
context is bounded enough that newline-spanning is harmless, and
literal token sequences (`",b:` etc.) when stricter adjacency is
required.

## Quote style: `"` is not stable either

Whitespace tolerance assumes the *tokens* hold still and only the
spacing moves. Upstream 1.26832.0 broke that assumption: the bundler
changed and every string literal flipped from double quotes to
backticks. Same code, same strings, different delimiter.

Measured across the main-process files of both bundles:

| bundle | `"short-literal"` | `` `short-literal` `` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.24012.11 | 46,526 | 429 |
| 1.26832.0 | 3,050 | 44,701 |

A near-total inversion. Four of the ten anchors in the active suite
matched on a `"`-delimited literal and went to zero matches; they came
back the instant the delimiter was generalized. The build-fatal ones
failed the build, which is the outcome the guards are for, but the
diagnosis cost a full triage cycle because "anchor not found" reads as
"upstream deleted the feature" and the feature was untouched.

**Never write a bare quote in an anchor.** Use a quote class so all
three delimiters match:

```bash
# Bad: pins the delimiter the current minifier happens to emit
grep -oP '[$\w]+(?=\.setAlwaysOnTop\(\s*!0\s*,\s*"pop-up-menu"\))'

# Good: tolerates ", ' and `
grep -oP '[$\w]+(?=\.setAlwaysOnTop\(\s*!0\s*,\s*[`"'"'"']pop-up-menu[`"'"'"']\))'
```

In the `node` heredoc patches, build the class once and concatenate it
rather than repeating the escaping:

```js
// Quote-class helper: match a literal under any delimiter.
const q = s => '[`"\']' + s + '[`"\']';
const arrRe = new RegExp('\\[\\s*' + q('\\/usr\\/libexec\\/virtiofsd') +
    '\\s*,\\s*' + q('\\/usr\\/bin\\/virtiofsd') + '\\s*\\]');
```

Two related shifts landed in the same bump, so a bundler swap should be
treated as a class of breakage rather than one delimiter change:

- **Syntax level rose.** Optional chaining is now preserved instead of
  being downleveled. An anchor written against
  `(e==null?void 0:e.id)==="ubuntu"` has to also accept
  ``e?.id===`ubuntu` ``. `let` likewise replaced most `const`/`var`
  emission, so `(?:const|let)` beats either alone.
- **Callee indirection appeared where there was none.** `X.spawn(` became
  `(0,ye.spawn)(`. The tray patch already tolerated this shape; it is now
  the default, not a special case, and every call-site anchor wants it.
  Tolerate the plain property chain in the same alternation —
  `(?:\(0,\s*[\w$]+(?:\.[\w$]+)*\)|[\w$]+(?:\.[\w$]+)*)`. The tray patch
  originally shipped without that second `(?:\.[\w$]+)*` and mispatched
  two releases; see "A capture narrower than the shape splices
  mid-identifier" above.

One inference worth flagging rather than asserting: when concatenation
is re-emitted as interpolation, a message that was one contiguous
literal (`"...completed in "+m+"ms"`) becomes a template with a
`${...}` hole in the middle, so an anchor spanning that hole breaks
even though the delimiter class is right. Anchor on the *stable prefix*
before the first interpolation (`[warm] Promoting warm file`), not on a
whole sentence.

## Replacement-string escaping: `\1`, `&`, `$1`

A regex can match correctly and still produce corrupted output
because the *replacement string* has its own metacharacters. Match
debugging shows green; the asar still ships broken bytes. Three
flavors:

**sed `&`** — the entire match. `sed 's/foo/&_suffix/'` is fine
(`foo_suffix`). `sed 's/foo/literal_&_dollar/'` accidentally
interpolates the match (`literal_foo_dollar`). Escape with `\&` if
you want a literal ampersand:

```bash
sed 's/foo/literal_\&_dollar/'   # → literal_&_dollar
```

**sed `\1`** — backreferences in the replacement. These work as
expected in BRE/ERE. The footgun is the *pattern* side: in BRE, `$`
is the end-of-line anchor, so a literal `$` in the search pattern
needs `\$`. The patches' shared `_common.sh:25` did exactly this for
`electron_var`, which could be `$e` on newer upstream (historical
example — helper deleted with the patch suite in v3.0.0, lesson
stands):

```bash
electron_var_re="${electron_var//\$/\\$}"
```

That escaping is for the sed *pattern*, not its replacement.

**JS `String.prototype.replace`: `$1`, `$&`, `$$`** — the JS
replacement DSL is its own thing. `$&` is the whole match; `$1..$9`
are capture groups; `$$` is a literal `$`. Plain `$` followed by an
unrelated char is left alone, but `$&` and `$N` get interpolated:

```js
code.replace(/foo/g, '$cost')   // → '$cost' (safe, no special)
code.replace(/foo/g, '$&_x')    // → 'foo_x' ($& = match)
code.replace(/foo/g, '$$cost')  // → '$cost' (escaped)
```

If the replacement is an injected JS snippet that happens to
contain `$1` or `$&` (template literals, jQuery, regex source), JS
will eat them. Use `$$` to escape, or build the string with
concatenation so `$` never sits next to a digit or `&`.

## Idempotency: a re-run must be byte-identical

Without it, CI re-runs and partial builds layer mutations until
something breaks visibly. Three patterns (all three cited from
`tray.sh`/`cowork.sh` — historical examples, patches deleted in
v3.0.0, lessons stand):

**Re-key the guard to post-rename names.** `tray.sh:174-180` keys its
fast-path guard on the post-rename
`${tray_var}.setImage(${electron_var}.nativeImage.createFromPath(${path_var}))`
sequence, so the second run recognizes its own first-run output.

**Negative lookbehind, inline.** `cowork.sh:102-106` — the
`(?<!...)` prevents a second match against text the first run
already wrapped:

```js
const logRe = new RegExp(
    '(?<!\\|\\|process\\.platform==="linux"\\))' +
    win32Var.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&') +
    '(\\s*\\?\\s*"vmClient \\(TypeScript\\)")'
);
```

**Explicit `code.includes(...)` check.** `cowork.sh:227-230`
separates "anchor missing" from "already applied" in the build log:

```js
} else if (code.includes(
    'getDownloadStatus(){return process.platform==="linux"?'
)) {
    console.log('  Cowork auto-nav suppression already applied');
}
```

PR #436 verified by running the patch twice and diffing the output.

## Anchor selection: prefer literals over identifiers

The above sections cover making a patch work on first run. This one
covers keeping it working release after release. A patch can apply
cleanly today and silently no-op next month.

Minified identifiers churn every release. Developer strings —
property names, log messages, IPC channel names — survive
minification untouched (true for the upstream bundler used here; a
`--mangle-props` build would invalidate property-name anchors).
Anchor on those. A hardcoded minified name silently no-ops the next
release; the build log still says "patched."

The string *content* survives; its *delimiter* does not, and neither
does the syntax around it. Match literals through a quote class and
keep the surrounding call shape loose — see "Quote style: `"` is not
stable either" above, which is how the whole suite broke on 1.26832.0.

Three patterns from the suite (quick-window survives the v3.0.0
rebase; the cowork and tray examples are historical — patches deleted
in v3.0.0, lessons stand):

- **Quick-window (PR #390, fixing #144).** Original patch:
  `s/e.hide()/e.blur(),e.hide()/`. When `e` became `Sa`, it no-oped.
  The rewrite anchors on `"pop-up-menu"` (`quick-window.sh:17`), the
  `isWindowFocused` property name (`quick-window.sh:60`), and the
  `[QuickEntry]` log strings (`quick-window.sh:88-91`).
- **Cowork spawn (PR #436).** Anchored on `,VAR.mountConda)`
  (`cowork.sh:741`) — unique to the 12-arg call path, absent from the
  10-arg one-shot. Asserts match count is exactly 1 and bails
  otherwise (`cowork.sh:744`), so a future second caller surfaces
  immediately.
- **Tray (PR #515).** `tray.sh:16` uses the literal `"menuBarEnabled"`
  as a *position anchor*, then captures the surrounding minified
  identifier (`\K\w+(?=\(\)\})`) as the actual patch target. Two
  stages: stable literal → derived identifier. Every other tray name
  chains off that single dynamic extraction.

The lesson is about finding stable points to anchor on, not about
what gets patched. The patch target is usually a minified identifier;
the *anchor* should be a developer string nearby.

## Multi-site coordinated patches: surface partial application

Site 1 patches, site 2 misses, the asar ships half-wired. The
pattern: each sub-patch sets a per-site boolean flag on success,
then a single named WARNING fires if any flag is false:

```js
if (!siteADone || !siteBDone) {
    console.log('  WARNING: <ticket> partial — siteA=' + siteADone +
        ' siteB=' + siteBDone + '; <fallback consequence>');
}
```

CI greps the build log for `WARNING:` and fails the build. That
catches the half-patched state even when individual sub-patches each
log "applied." See `cowork.sh:759-763` for a real instance
(historical example — patch deleted in v3.0.0, lesson stands) —
three-site `sharedCwdPath` forwarding, daemon fallback if any site
misses.

## Disambiguating non-unique anchors: lastIndexOf over indexOf

A string anchor can appear in source maps, dead exports, or
chunk-merged duplicates alongside the live code. `indexOf` returns
the first; that may be wrong.

`cowork.sh:264` (historical example — patch deleted in v3.0.0, lesson
stands) uses `lastIndexOf(serviceErrorStr)` to bias toward
appended code. On 1.5354.0 the string occurs once, so the change is
a no-op there — the defense is for a future upstream that
reintroduces the string in onboarding text or sample data far from
the live retry-loop site.

When neither side is reliable, narrow the search region first.
`cowork.sh:269-276` does this for the ENOENT check, scanning only a
300-character window before the error string.

## Code-split bundles: resolve the file, don't hardcode it

For years the whole main process lived in one file,
`.vite/build/index.js`, and every patch hardcoded that path. Upstream
1.19367.0 code-split it: `index.js` became a ~700-byte entry stub that
`require()`s a content-hashed main chunk (`index.chunk-<hash>.js`),
which pulls in ~40 more `index.chunk-<hash>.js` files (86 by
1.24012.11, 325 by 1.26832.0). The hash changes
every release, so the name can't be hardcoded either. Every patch
anchored on the literal `index.js` path silently missed — the
build-fatal ones (`virtiofsd-probe`, `cowork-bwrap` A/B) failed the
build, the WARN-only ones (`quick-window`, `org-plugins`) skipped and
shipped an under-patched asar.

Two rules fall out, both now in `app-asar.sh` / the patch suite:

- **Resolve the target file, don't name it.** `_resolve_main_js`
  (`app-asar.sh`) follows the stub's `require("./index.chunk-<hash>.js")`
  to the main chunk and falls back to `index.js` for the pre-split
  layout, so both bundle shapes work. It fails loud if `index.js` ever
  requires more than one main chunk (a future deeper split), rather than
  patching the wrong one silently. Patches read `$main_js`.

- **One logical patch can span chunks.** The split follows dynamic
  `import()` boundaries, so an optional subsystem can land in its own
  chunk apart from the code that gates it. `cowork-bwrap`'s A/B/C1 were
  in the main chunk, but its warm-prefetch block (C2) moved to a
  separate warm chunk — resolved there by a stable `[warm]` log literal,
  exactly the "anchor on a developer string, then find the file that
  carries it" move. Don't assume the whole patch touches one file.

**The single-chunk assumption died in 1.26832.0.** That release
dissolved the core: `index.js` went from a 773-byte stub with one
`require()` to a 195,889-byte file issuing 104 `require()` calls across
83 distinct chunks, and the 5.2 MB core chunk was replaced by a largest
chunk of 1.28 MB. Total main-process bytes moved +2.4%, so this was a
re-split of existing code, not new code — the core-shrink signature.
`_resolve_main_js`'s multi-chunk guard fired exactly as designed and
failed the build rather than mispatching, which is the outcome to want,
but it means the "resolve one file, hand it to every patch" contract is
finished. Anchors now live in three different places at once: the tray
ternary in `index.js` itself, quick-window and org-plugins and virtiofsd
in `index.chunk-*` files, and the cowork evaluator in a second
`index2.chunk-*` family that did not exist before.

Resolution has to become per-anchor: grep the whole `.vite/build` tree
for the anchor's stable literal, assert exactly one file carries it,
patch that file. `cowork-bwrap` already did this for its warm chunk
(`grep -lF '[warm] ...'`), and that one-off is the shape the rest of the
suite needs. Two traps the census surfaced:

- **Presence is not the anchor.** `pop-up-menu` appears in two 1.26832.0
  chunks, but only one carries the `setAlwaysOnTop(!0,...)` call the
  patch actually rewrites. Resolve on the *full anchor shape*, not on the
  distinctive string alone, or the exactly-one assertion picks a decoy.
- **A missing anchor is not always a missing feature.** Of the four
  1.26832.0 anchors that survived the quote-class fix and still missed,
  every one was a genuine upstream reshape rather than a deletion: the
  virtiofsd resolver now returns `await FT(kT)||...` where it returned a
  bare identifier, and `cowork-bwrap` C1 inverted polarity from
  ``(x?.status)!=="supported"?!1:`` to ``x?.status===`supported`?(...)``.
  An inverted guard is the dangerous one — a regex loose enough to match
  both shapes would install the gate backwards. The fix is to stop the
  anchor *before* the comparison: C1 matches only the function head and
  destructure, then injects ahead of upstream's check, which is correct
  under either polarity because it never has to agree with one.

### Adjacency is an assumption too

Stopping the anchor early leaves it holding one last unstated
assumption: that the tokens it *does* span stay next to each other.
1.37937.1 broke C1 again on exactly that. Same function, same
destructure, same `return` — upstream inserted one statement in front:

```js
1.26832.0:  async function ut(e,n){let{yukonSilver:r}=p.n();return …
1.37937.1:  async function QH(e,t){await nB();let{yukonSilver:r}=iB();return …
```

The anchor required the destructure to sit immediately after the opening
brace, so it went to zero matches and `_resolve_anchor_file` failed the
build — through four upstream bumps (1.37937.1, 1.37937.3, 1.40609.0,
1.40609.1) in which no release shipped. Worth noting how it read: an
anchor that *lost a feature* and an anchor that *gained a statement*
produce the same "matched no file" line, and the second is by far the
likelier of the two.

Leave a bounded prelude between the tokens you span, and fence it on
braces rather than on `.`:

```
async function\s+[\w$]+\([\w$]+,[\w$]+\)\{ [^{}]{0,80} (?:const|let)\{yukonSilver:…
```

`[^{}]` cannot cross a nested block or leave the function body, so the
budget buys a couple of simple statements and nothing structural — where
`.{0,80}` would happily reach past an `if(e){t()}` and gate a function
whose head is 80 bytes from an unrelated destructure. It also absorbs a
`;` inside a template literal, which a statement-counting
`(?:[^{};]*;){0,2}` splits on.

Loosening buys back the match at the cost of the uniqueness the tight
version got for free, so pay for it in two places at once:

- **Keep a discriminator past the loosened joint.** C1's was the
  `();return` tail (since replaced by a log literal — next section).
  `startVM` in the same chunk opened identically and destructured the
  same property, and was told apart only by continuing into `if(`
  instead of `return`. Drop the tail and the gate installs on the wrong
  function.
- **Assert exactly one match.** `replace()` silently takes the first.
  The count assertion is what turns a future second call site into a
  named warning instead of a coin flip — the same guard patches A and B
  already carried.

### The terminus is an assumption too

1.46388.2 broke C1 a third time, and this one had nothing to do with
spacing. The destructure the anchor ended on was simply gone:

```js
1.37937.1:  async function QH(e,t){await nB();let{yukonSilver:r}=iB();return r?.status===`supported`&&(…
1.46388.2:  async function YU(e,t){return await wB(),EB().status==="supported"&&(…
```

Same function, same guard, same log line — the status now comes off a
helper call instead of a local. The `();return` discriminator that told
the download function apart from `startVM` was pinned to a *statement
shape*, and statement shapes are the minifier's to rearrange. Both the
prelude and the terminus had been chosen as syntax; the only thing in
the function that held across all three reshapes was the developer
string in its body (`[downloadVM] Download already in progress`), with
nothing but its delimiter moving.

So the terminus is now that literal, and the head→literal stretch is
fenced instead of pinned:

```
async function\s+[\w$]+\([\w$]+,[\w$]+\)\{ (?:[^{}]|\{yukonSilver:[\w$]+\}){0,240}? \[downloadVM\] Download already in progress
```

Three things carry over from the prelude lesson. The fence is still
`[^{}]`, and the one brace pair it admits is spelled out as the
destructure the older shapes carry — a fence that admitted any `{…}`
pair would step over `if(e){t()}` exactly as `.` would. The
exactly-one assertion stays. And the literal is a *prefix* of the
message, cut before `, waiting...`, so a future re-emission as a
template with an interpolation hole cannot split it.

One new trap the widening exposed: a body budget generous enough for
the real function is also generous enough to absorb the patch's own
injected gate on a re-run, which makes the marker allowance from the
next section silently redundant — until upstream grows the prelude and
the second pass fails at resolution. The mutation check is what
surfaced it: dropping the allowance went green. The gate is now braced
(`if(…){return!1}`) so the fence cannot swallow it, and dropping the
allowance goes red in the idempotency test instead of in a future
build. When a mutation on defensive code comes back green, ask what
*else* is covering for it, and whether that cover has a budget.

### A resolution anchor must survive its own patch

Once a patch resolves its own file, the anchor acquires a second job it
never had as a patch-site anchor: it has to still match *after* the patch
has run. Six of the first ten anchors written for #820 failed that.
`org-plugins` resolves on the compound `` `org-plugins`);default:return
null `` shape and then inserts a `case"linux"` between those two halves;
`cowork-bwrap` A resolves on a function head it rewrites; the tray patch
resolves on a ternary condition it replaces. Every one resolved fine on a
clean tree and failed on a re-run — and failed *at resolution*, so the
carefully written idempotency guards inside each patch never got to run.

The build normally extracts a fresh asar, so this hides in production and
surfaces only under a second pass. Test it explicitly: run the whole
patch stage twice against the same tree and assert the second run is a
no-op and the repacked archive is byte-identical.

Pick a resolution anchor the patch provably never rewrites, which is
usually *adjacent* to the patch site rather than at it:

| patch | resolves on | why it survives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `org-plugins` | `Application Support/Claude/org-plugins` | the darwin path; the insert lands elsewhere in the switch |
| `cowork-bwrap` A | `return process.platform,X()}` | the injected early-return goes in front of it, not through it |
| `cowork-bwrap` B | the `-socket` literal | re-emitted verbatim in both branches of the swapped call |
| tray | the two adjacent `TrayIconLinux*.png` literals | the condition is rewritten, the literals are re-emitted |

Where that is impossible, teach the anchor to tolerate the patch's own
marker — `cowork-bwrap` C1 allows an optional braced
`/*cowork-bwrap-dl*/if(…){return!1}` segment between the function head
and the body it fences (the braces are what keep that allowance
load-bearing — see the previous section).

One mechanical footnote: resolve with `grep -lPz`, not `grep -lP`. Bare
`-P` is line-oriented, so a `\s*` in the anchor cannot cross a newline
and every multi-line beautified bundle reports the anchor missing —
the beautified false-negative trap again, this time in the resolver
rather than in the patch.

The corollary for anchor uniqueness: a literal that was unique across
one 15 MB file can now recur across ~50 chunks (source-map tails,
dead re-exports, the same string logged from two subsystems). Confirm
your anchor is unique *within the resolved file*, not just present —
`grep -c` the specific chunk, not the whole `.vite/build` tree. The
tripwires (`_check_upstream_tripwires`) are the exception that still
greps the whole asar on purpose: they only assert a behavior marker
exists *somewhere*, so a relocated marker is fine.

## Verifying a hypothesis before shipping a fix

Pull the pinned pool path and SHA from `scripts/setup/official-deb.sh`,
download the official `.deb`, verify the hash, extract without
beautifying, and test the regex against the minified bytes:

```bash
base=$(grep -oP "OFFICIAL_APT_BASE='\K[^']+" \
    scripts/setup/official-deb.sh)
pool=$(grep -oP "OFFICIAL_DEB_POOL_AMD64='\K[^']+" \
    scripts/setup/official-deb.sh)
expected=$(grep -oP "OFFICIAL_DEB_SHA256_AMD64='\K[^']+" \
    scripts/setup/official-deb.sh)
mkdir -p /tmp/verify && cd /tmp/verify
wget -q -O claude-desktop.deb "$base/$pool"
echo "$expected  claude-desktop.deb" | sha256sum -c -

ar p claude-desktop.deb data.tar.xz | tar -J -x
npx asar extract usr/lib/claude-desktop/resources/app.asar app

node -e '
  const fs = require("fs");
  const code = fs.readFileSync(
    "app/.vite/build/index.js", "utf8");
  const re = /await new Promise\(([\w$]+)=>\s*setTimeout\(\1,\s*([\w$]+)\)\)/;
  const m = code.match(re);
  console.log(m ? `MATCH: ${m[0]}` : "NO MATCH");
'
```

`NO MATCH` means the regex is wrong. Verifying the SHA defends against
stale URL pinning or server-side binary swap. If `ar t
claude-desktop.deb` shows a member other than `data.tar.xz`, swap the
tar flag — `_extract_deb_member` in `scripts/setup/official-deb.sh`
handles zst/xz/gz the same way and is the reference.

## End-to-end verification (post-build)

Four layers: build log, syntactic validity, asar markers, runtime.

1. Check the patch log:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh --build appimage --clean no 2>&1 | tee build.log
   grep -E 'Active asar patches|WARNING:' build.log
   ```

   A healthy build logs `Active asar patches: patch_quick_window
   patch_org_plugins_path patch_virtiofsd_probe patch_cowork_bwrap`, a
   `Main-process JS: …/index.chunk-<hash>.js` line, and no `WARNING:`.
   (Historical example — a healthy 1.5354.0 build logged `Applied 12
   cowork patches`, and a lower count or any `WARNING:` in the cowork
   section meant a half-patched asar; the cowork patches were deleted
   in v3.0.0, the lesson stands.)

2. `node --check` on the patched `index.js` — catches malformed
   replacements that serialize but don't parse (PR #436 used this in
   dry-run validation):

   ```bash
   node --check test-build/.../app.asar.contents/.vite/build/index.js
   ```

3. Static-grep the shipped asar for markers — asar stores file
   contents uncompressed, so `grep -a` works against the archive
   without extracting. A dedicated checker (`verify-patches.sh`,
   issue #559 D6) automated this for the 9 cowork markers from PR
   #555 until it was deleted with the cowork patch set in v3.0.0; the
   surviving form of the layer is `_check_upstream_tripwires` in
   `scripts/patches/app-asar.sh`, which greps the pristine asar for
   upstream-behavior anchors (AU-1 `apt_channel_pending`, MB-1
   `menuBarEnabled:!0`) and fails the build if one disappears.

4. Launch the AppImage and check runtime state (the checks below are
   for the deleted cowork daemon patches — historical example, the
   layer stands: verify the runtime effect of whatever was patched):

   ```bash
   tail -20 ~/.config/Claude/logs/cowork_vm_daemon.log
   ls -la "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/cowork-vm-service.sock"
   ss -lpx | grep cowork-vm-service.sock
   ```

   Daemon log should have `lifecycle startup` and `lifecycle
   listening`; socket should exist and be owned by the
   `cowork-vm-service.js` process listed by `ss`.

## One gate, multiple consumers: a marker can't catch a re-armed sibling

A single minified predicate is often read by several independent code
paths. Patching it at the source flips *all* of them — some you want,
some you don't — and a marker-based check won't catch the ones you
didn't, because nothing is *missing*; the regression is behavioral.

The yukonSilver cowork gate (1.13576+) is the case study (historical
example — the cowork patches were deleted in v3.0.0, lesson stands). The support
evaluator `$oe()`/`q4r()` returns `{status:"supported"|"unsupported"}`,
and at least four call sites read it: `startVM` (execution gate), the
renderer (the Cowork tab's grayed-out / "reinstall" state), the
download driver `u8A`, and the warm prefetch `mzn`. The tab was grayed
out on Linux because the evaluator reported `unsupported` (the win32
`q4r` probe hits `msix_required`). Flipping it to `supported` for Linux
(`cowork.sh` Patch 1b) un-grayed the tab — and simultaneously re-armed
the multi-GB `rootfs.vhdx` VM download that #337/`a3190c3` had disabled,
because the two download consumers read the *same* evaluator.

The marker checker of the day (`verify-patches.sh`, since deleted in
v3.0.0) was green throughout: Patch 1b's marker was present, and there
was no "download must stay off" marker to go red. The only
thing that surfaced it was launching the build and watching
`cowork_vm_node.log` (`rootfs.vhdx not found, downloading...`). The fix
was not to un-flip the evaluator but to re-block the now-reachable
consumers individually — Patch 1c adds `process.platform==="linux"||`
to `u8A` and `mzn` so they behave as they did under `unsupported`,
while the evaluator stays `supported` for the renderer.

Two rules fall out of this:

- **Before flipping a shared gate, grep every read of the predicate**
  (here `\.status\)!=="supported"` / `status!=="supported"`). Enumerate
  the consumers and decide per-site which should follow the flip. A
  patch that "works" against the symptom you were chasing can arm a
  sibling you weren't looking at.
- **Markers verify structure; only a runtime launch verifies
  behavior.** When a patch changes a value that other code branches on,
  the post-build click-through (and a log tail for unwanted side
  effects) is not optional — the static layers (build log, `node
  --check`, markers) are all blind to a re-armed consumer. Add a
  positive marker for the *counter*-patch (Patch 1c ships
  `vm-download-blocked-linux` + `warm-download-blocked-linux`) so the
  invariant you just restored has a fingerprint that can go red.

  for dynamic extraction across a six-variable patch site and the
  post-rename idempotency-guard pattern.
- `plugin-install.md` "Getting the Minified Source for Any Shipped
